# 🖥️ Calculator

Functional Calculator.

## Prerequisites

This project runs properly with **Java 18**. Make sure you have it installed with `java -version`

## 💻 How to Use
To use the Calculator you will have to run through the console. The easiest way to do it **requires having Maven installed** in your computer. You can **follow [this tutorial](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)**. 

Having Maven installed, go to the root directory, open the terminal of your choice (cmd, Powershell or git bash) and run the following command:
`mvn clean`
`mvn install`

If you don't have Maven installed, run the Application file. It will usually be called `CalculatorApplication.java`.
